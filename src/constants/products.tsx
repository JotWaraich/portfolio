        <h2>üìÇ File Sorting App - Simplify Your File Organization!</h2>

        <h3>‚ú® Key Features</h3>

          <li>
            <strong>Smart File Organization:</strong> Automatically sorts files
            into categorized folders such as <code>Audio</code>,{" "}
            <code>Video</code>, <code>Images</code>, and more, making it easier
            to find what you need.
          </li>

        <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Recent Improvements</h3>
        <p>
          In the latest version, we‚Äôve enhanced the sorting logic to group
          common file types into more generalized categories like{" "}
          <code>Audio</code>, <code>Video</code>, <code>Images</code>, and{" "}
          <code>Documents</code>, instead of creating separate folders for each
          file extension. This results in a cleaner and more organized directory
          structure.
